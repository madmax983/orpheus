## 2023-10-27 - [OOM via Vec::with_capacity]
**Learning:** Pre-allocating a `Vec` based on an unverified user-supplied size constraint (like a header count) can lead to an Out-of-Memory (OOM) panic. Also, performing arithmetic (like `expected + 1`) on such an unverified value before capping it can result in an integer overflow panic in debug mode.
**Action:** Always safely clamp the capacity estimate (e.g., `.saturating_add(1).min(1024)`) so the collection falls back to standard dynamic resizing for extreme cases.

**[Extreme Float-to-Integer Saturation]**
**Learning:** In Rust, casting an out-of-bounds float to an integer directly (`value.round() as i128`) no longer causes undefined behavior, but it silently saturates to the boundary (`i128::MAX` or `MIN`). This defeats bounds checking if the check occurs *after* the cast, hiding garbage input from the system.
**Action:** Always perform strict boundary comparisons (`if value > std::i128::MAX as f64`) on the float type *before* attempting the `as` cast to prevent silent logical bugs.
## 2023-10-31 - [Tracker Export Emoji OOB Slice Panic]
**Learning:** Hardcoding string slice indexing like `&sample[..4]` causes panics when the boundary splits a multi-byte Unicode sequence (such as an emoji or complex character like `👹`).
**Action:** Use `.chars().take(4).collect::<String>()` instead of direct byte slicing for length-limited Unicode strings.
## 2023-10-31 - [Fuzzing Evaluation Resilience & Pattern Match Exhaustiveness]
**Learning:** `E0004: non-exhaustive patterns` compilation errors occur when adding new variants to central enums (like `BuiltinKind`) without updating matching functions downstream (`name()`, `arity()`, `execute()`). Fuzzing via `cargo-fuzz` confirmed the evaluation system handles malformed strings gracefully without crashing.
**Action:** When adding enum variants, systematically check and update all downstream match blocks. Ensure all systems compiling after a feature addition don't just compile but also withstand `cargo-fuzz` without panicking.
## 2025-02-28 - Float Bounds Precision Loss Bypass
**The Target:** `eval_positive_integer` in `crates/orpheus-lang/src/eval.rs` which verifies large floating point boundaries using `i128::MAX as f64`.
**The Finding:** Checking a parsed float against `i128::MAX as f64` bypasses the bounds check for extremely large numbers (e.g. 1.0e16) due to 64-bit float precision truncation. This allows massive integers to be silently returned via `value.round() as i128` truncations, bypassing all internal API validation for sizes and panicking downstream on out-of-memory array constructions or shift bounds.
**The Action:** Injected a 'soft bound' of `1.0e15_f64` before doing direct large bounds assertions or cast boundaries, throwing an explicit out of bounds error before the cast can truncate the values.
